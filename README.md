# Vitest MCP Server

A **production-ready** Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for running Vitest tests and analyzing coverage. This server provides AI assistants with intelligent tools for test-driven development workflows.

## üöÄ Features

- **Health Check Tool** - Server connectivity verification
- **Test Execution Tool** - Run Vitest tests with complete results
- **Coverage Analysis Tool** - Detailed coverage reports with uncovered line analysis
- **Intelligent Resources** - Access test results and coverage data as resources
- **Smart Caching** - Automatic result caching for seamless data flow
- **Auto-Discovery** - Automatically finds your Vitest configuration
- **Robust Execution** - Fixed JSON parsing and execution reliability (v1.0.5)

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install @madrus/vitest-mcp-server
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### As a Standalone MCP Server

```bash
# Run the server directly
npx @madrus/vitest-mcp-server

# Or if installed globally
vitest-mcp-server
```

### Integration with AI Assistants

Configure your AI assistant (like Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) to use this MCP server.

#### Why This MCP Server Needs Environment Variables

**Unlike many other MCP servers**, this one executes Vitest commands that must run in your specific project directory. Here's why:

- **Most MCP servers** just analyze files, make API calls, or provide static information
- **This MCP server** actually executes `vitest run` and `vitest --coverage` commands
- **Vitest requires** its working directory to be your project root to find:
  - `vitest.config.ts/js`
  - `package.json`
  - Test files
  - Source files for coverage analysis
- **MCP servers run** in their own process/directory, not your project directory
- **Without `VITEST_PROJECT_DIR`**, Vitest can't find your config and fails

**Bottom line**: The environment variable tells Vitest where YOUR project lives, since the MCP server process runs elsewhere.

#### Optimized Configuration (Recommended)

For best performance and reliability, use only the environment variable (the `cwd` is redundant):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vitest-runner": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@madrus/vitest-mcp-server@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "VITEST_PROJECT_DIR": "/Users/<your-username>/path/to/your/project/root"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Basic Configuration (Minimal)

If you want to try without the environment variable (may work in some setups):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vitest-runner": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@madrus/vitest-mcp-server@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Configuration Locations

**Cursor (macOS/Linux):**
- File: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
- Full path: `/Users/<your-username>/.cursor/mcp.json`

**Claude Desktop (macOS):**
- File: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Claude Desktop (Windows):**
- File: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

#### Example Complete Configuration

Here's a complete example for Cursor with multiple MCP servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vitest-runner": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@madrus/vitest-mcp-server@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "VITEST_PROJECT_DIR": "/Users/<your-username>/path/to/your/project/root"
      }
    },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Important Setup Notes

1. **Replace placeholders**: Change `/Users/<your-username>/path/to/your/project/root` to your actual project path
2. **Project root**: The path should point to your project's root directory (where `package.json` and Vitest config files are located)
3. **Restart required**: After updating your MCP configuration, restart your AI assistant (Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.)
4. **Verify setup**: Use the `ping` tool to verify the server is working correctly

#### Troubleshooting MCP Configuration

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

1. **Server fails to start or times out:**
   - Check that your project path in `VITEST_PROJECT_DIR` is correct and absolute
   - Verify the path exists and contains `package.json`
   - Try running `npx vitest run` manually in your project directory

2. **"Cannot find vitest config" errors:**
   - Ensure your project has a `vitest.config.ts/js` or `vite.config.ts/js` file
   - Check that Vitest is installed in your project: `npm list vitest`
   - Verify the config file is in the directory specified by `VITEST_PROJECT_DIR`

3. **JSON parsing errors (fixed in v1.0.5):**
   - Update to the latest version: `@madrus/vitest-mcp-server@latest`
   - Clear any cached versions and restart your AI assistant

4. **Tests don't run but server connects:**
   - Test manually: `cd /your/project && npx vitest run`
   - Check that your test files are properly configured in your Vitest config
   - Ensure test files exist and are discoverable by Vitest

5. **Coverage tool shows 0 tests (fixed in v1.0.5):**
   - This was a known issue in v1.0.3-1.0.4, update to v1.0.5+
   - The coverage tool now properly executes tests AND generates coverage

### Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import { McpServer } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js'
import { registerRunVitestTool, registerRunVitestCoverageTool } from '@madrus/vitest-mcp-server/tools'

const server = new McpServer(
  { name: 'my-server', version: '1.0.0' },
  { capabilities: { tools: {}, resources: {} } }
)

// Register the tools
registerRunVitestTool(server)
registerRunVitestCoverageTool(server)
```

    }
  }
}
```

## üîß Configuration

### Project Detection

The server automatically detects your Vitest configuration by looking for:
- `vitest.config.ts`
- `vitest.config.js`
- `vitest.config.mjs`
- `vite.config.ts`
- `vite.config.js`
- `vite.config.mjs`

You can override the project directory using:
1. Tool parameter: `projectDir`
2. Environment variable: `VITEST_PROJECT_DIR` (recommended)
3. Auto-detection (default, may not work in all MCP setups)

### Environment Variables

| Variable             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Required | Default       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `VITEST_PROJECT_DIR` | **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**: Specifies your project directory since MCP servers run in isolated processes. Unlike other MCPs that just analyze files, this one executes Vitest commands that need to run in your project root. | No       | Auto-detected |
| `NODE_ENV`           | Set automatically to `test` during execution. You don't need to set this manually.                                                                                                                                        | No       | `test`        |

**Why `VITEST_PROJECT_DIR` is important:**
- Most MCP servers just read files or make API calls
- This MCP server executes `vitest run` which must find your project's config files
- MCP servers run in their own process, not in your project directory
- Without this variable, Vitest may fail to find your configuration
